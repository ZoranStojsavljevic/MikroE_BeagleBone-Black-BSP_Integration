The Click boardâ„¢ is equipped with a number of SMD jumpers. There are five jumpers grouped
under the COMM SEL label, used to select one of two available interfaces: SPI, and I2C. By
moving all the jumpers at the desired position, the user can select the interface used for 
the communication with the host MCU. It is advisable to move all the jumpers at once to
either left (SPI) or the right (I2C) position.

All the jumpers/0 Ohm resistors are positioned on the left side (SPI interface).
